# bridge-gameplay-api

`unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary` — agent sensors + navigation for PIE automation.

MVP scope: **perception + path planning only**. Actuators (`apply_movement_input`, `press_action`, etc.) are a separate library addition planned after this path is validated.

Requires PIE to be running for `get_agent_observation`. `find_nav_path` falls back to the editor world when PIE is off — useful for precomputing routes.

---

## get_agent_observation(max_actor_distance, require_line_of_sight, class_filter) -> FAgentObservation or None

Assemble a full snapshot of the player pawn's perceptible world in one call.

**Parameters**
- `max_actor_distance` (float, default 3000.0 cm): filter radius; actors farther than this are dropped from `visible_actors`.
- `require_line_of_sight` (bool, default True): if True, line-trace camera→actor and drop occluded actors (visibility channel).
- `class_filter` (str, default ""): case-insensitive substring match on the actor's class name. Empty = no class filter.

**Returns** — `FAgentObservation` struct:
- `valid` (bool): False if PIE isn't running or there's no player pawn yet.
- `pawn_location` (Vector), `pawn_rotation` (Rotator), `pawn_velocity` (Vector)
- `on_ground` (bool): False when the character is falling (via UCharacterMovementComponent::IsFalling); True for non-Character pawns.
- `camera_location` (Vector), `camera_forward` (Vector)
- `visible_actors` (array of `FAgentVisibleActor`): sorted by distance ascending. Each entry carries `actor_name` (FName), `class_name` (str), `location` (Vector), `distance` (float cm), `tags` (array of FName).

**Cost**
- O(N) scan of all actors in the PIE world; one line trace per candidate when `require_line_of_sight=True`.
- Single GameThread call. Typical <1 ms for small scenes, a few ms for actor-heavy levels with LoS filtering.

**Output footprint** — small. Size scales linearly with actor count within the radius. For a 30 Hz agent loop this is ~30 struct copies/second, negligible on the wire.

**Example**
```python
import unreal
obs = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_agent_observation(
    max_actor_distance=2500.0,
    require_line_of_sight=True,
    class_filter='Character',
)
if obs.valid:
    print(f'self@{obs.pawn_location} hp=ground={obs.on_ground}')
    for a in obs.visible_actors:
        print(f'  {a.class_name} {a.actor_name} dist={a.distance:.0f}')
```

**Pitfalls**
- Outside PIE returns `valid=False` (won't raise).
- `on_ground` is always True for non-ACharacter pawns — the `IsFalling()` check doesn't apply to raw APawn / APawn-derived vehicles.
- `class_name` is the UClass short name (e.g. `BP_PlayerCharacter_C`), not a path. Use a prefix like `class_filter='zombie'` to scope.

---

## find_nav_path(start_location, end_location) -> (success, waypoints, path_length)

Synchronously compute a navmesh path between two world-space points.

**Parameters**
- `start_location` (Vector): world-space source.
- `end_location` (Vector): world-space target.

**Returns** — tuple of:
- `success` (bool): True if a path was found.
- `out_waypoints` (array of Vector): `FNavPathPoint.Location` list, `waypoints[0]` = start, last entry = end-nearest navmesh point. Empty when success is False.
- `out_path_length` (float): sum of segment lengths in cm. 0.0 when success is False.

**World selection** — PIE world if PIE is active, otherwise the editor world. Both must have a built NavMesh (see `bridge-navigation-api.md` or call `execute_console_command('RebuildNavigation')` first).

**Cost**
- One synchronous `UNavigationSystemV1::FindPathToLocationSynchronously` call on the GameThread.
- Fast for local pathfinding (<5 ms typical); scales with corridor complexity.

**Output footprint** — small. Waypoint count is usually 2–20. At 30 Hz re-planning that's ~600 Vectors/s, negligible.

**Example**
```python
import unreal
ok, waypoints, length = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.find_nav_path(
    start_location=obs.pawn_location,
    end_location=unreal.Vector(1000, 500, 100),
)
print(f'path ok={ok} length={length:.0f}cm points={len(waypoints)}')
```

**Pitfalls**
- Path planning requires a built RecastNavMesh. If the level has no navmesh actor or it hasn't been built, this returns `(False, [], 0.0)`.
- Points far outside the navmesh are snapped to the nearest navmesh region by the query — the returned `waypoints[-1]` may not equal `end_location` exactly.
- Partial paths (end not reachable) currently return False. If you need partial routing, call `NavSys::FindPathToLocationSynchronously` directly.

---

## Navmesh utilities

All four queries use the PIE world's navmesh when PIE is running and
fall back to the editor world's navmesh otherwise — same behaviour as
`find_nav_path`. Output is `None` when no world / no `UNavigationSystemV1`
/ the query itself fails.

### project_point_to_navmesh(point, search_extent) -> Vector or None

Clamp `point` onto the nearest walkable navmesh surface within an
axis-aligned half-extent box `search_extent` (cm). Use this before
`find_nav_path` when the caller has an arbitrary world point (e.g. a
camera hit on a wall) that isn't itself on the navmesh.

```python
origin = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_camera_hit_location(10000.0)
if origin is not None:
    target = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.project_point_to_navmesh(
        origin, unreal.Vector(200, 200, 400))
```

### is_point_on_navmesh(point, tolerance=50.0) -> bool

Boolean variant of `project_point_to_navmesh` — True if any navmesh
surface exists within `(tolerance, tolerance, tolerance)` cm of the
query point.

### get_nav_mesh_bounds() -> (Vector, Vector) or None

World-space AABB of the navigable world. Returned as `(min, max)`
Vector tuple on success, `None` when no navmesh exists. Use to seed
random sampling or to sanity-check that a planned path origin lies
within the navigable region.

### get_random_reachable_point_in_radius(origin, radius) -> Vector or None

Pick a random navmesh point within `radius` cm of `origin` that is
**path-reachable from `origin`** — not just "on a navmesh nearby".
Different navmesh islands are rejected. Returns `None` when the radius
contains no reachable points.

```python
obs = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_agent_observation()
if obs.valid:
    wander = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_random_reachable_point_in_radius(
        obs.pawn_location, 1500.0)
```

**Pitfalls**

- All four queries return None outside a navmesh-enabled level, even if
  `find_nav_path` was previously working — the level's navmesh may have
  been invalidated. Call `execute_console_command('RebuildNavigation')`
  from `bridge-editor-api` and retry.
- `search_extent` / `tolerance` must be positive — internally clamped
  to a minimum of 1 cm.

---

## Screen-space perception

All four helpers require PIE to be running with a valid player
controller — outside PIE they return `None` / `False`. Normalized
coordinates use `[0,1]` with origin at the top-left of the viewport.

### get_pie_viewport_size() -> Vector2D or None

PIE viewport pixel size (`x = width`, `y = height`). Use to denormalize
the [0,1] coordinates that project/deproject accept, or to reason about
aspect ratio.

### deproject_screen_to_world(normalized_x, normalized_y) -> (Vector, Vector) or None

Convert a normalized viewport position to a world-space ray. Returns a
`(origin, direction)` tuple on success; `direction` is unit-length.

```python
origin, direction = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.deproject_screen_to_world(0.5, 0.5)
```

### project_world_to_screen(world_location) -> Vector2D or None

Project a world point to the PIE viewport. Returns `Vector2D` with
normalized `[0,1]` coordinates when the point is on-screen, `None`
otherwise (behind camera, or outside the viewport rectangle).

```python
ui_pos = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.project_world_to_screen(
    unreal.Vector(1000, 0, 0))
```

### get_actor_at_screen_position(normalized_x, normalized_y, max_distance=10000.0) -> str

Convenience wrapper: deproject the screen position into a ray, line-trace
it (visibility channel, pawn ignored), return the first hit actor's
`FName` as string. Empty string on miss / no PIE.

```python
name = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_actor_at_screen_position(0.5, 0.5)
```

**Pitfalls**

- Results flicker during the first few PIE frames while the camera and
  viewport are still resolving — always gate on `is_in_pie()`.
- Off-screen points return `None` from `project_world_to_screen`, *not*
  a clamped coordinate — callers that need the projected-but-clipped
  pixel value should call `ProjectWorldLocationToScreen` in Python
  directly.

---

## Camera control + fast view query

Wrappers around `APlayerCameraManager`. All four functions require PIE
and a player controller; they return `None` / `-1.0` / `False`
otherwise.

### get_camera_fov() -> float

Current vertical FOV in degrees. Returns `-1.0` outside PIE.

### set_camera_fov(fov) -> bool

Override the camera FOV. Valid range: `[1.0, 170.0]` — values outside
that are rejected (returns False). The override persists until
`unlock_camera_fov` is called; it is *not* automatically cleared when
PIE stops.

```python
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.set_camera_fov(30.0)   # tight zoom
# ... inspect scene ...
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.unlock_camera_fov()
```

### unlock_camera_fov() -> bool

Clear the FOV override so the camera returns to whatever the active
view target provides (typically 90°).

### get_camera_view_point() -> (Vector, Rotator) or None

`APlayerController::GetPlayerViewPoint` wrapper — returns the current
camera world location and rotation as a tuple. Cheaper than assembling
a full `FAgentObservation` when you only need the view transform (e.g.
recording a cinematography path).

---

## Character movement tuning

All four helpers target the PIE player pawn's
`UCharacterMovementComponent`. Non-Character pawns (raw APawn
subclasses without CharMove) return `-1.0` / `False` across the board.

### get_pawn_max_walk_speed() -> float

`MaxWalkSpeed` in cm/s. Returns `-1.0` when PIE isn't running or no
Character pawn exists.

### set_pawn_max_walk_speed(speed) -> bool

Override `MaxWalkSpeed`. Negative values rejected. Does NOT touch
`MaxAcceleration` — the pawn ramps to the new speed over a few frames
via existing acceleration rules. Persists until overwritten; NOT
reset automatically when PIE stops.

### set_pawn_gravity_scale(scale) -> bool

Override `GravityScale`. `1.0` = default, `0.0` = zero-g, `2.0` =
double gravity. Negative values rejected. Useful for test scenarios
that need the pawn to hang in air or fall faster without changing
world gravity.

### get_pawn_speed() -> float

Magnitude of `APawn::GetVelocity()` in cm/s. Returns `-1.0` when no
pawn / no PIE. Works for any pawn type — falls back to
`AActor::GetVelocity` for non-Characters.

---

## PIE runtime spawn / destroy / query

These operate on the active PIE world. They are DISTINCT from the
`bridge-level-api` spawn/destroy pair, which target the editor world.
Use these when an agent script needs to place or remove test targets
mid-PIE without editing the saved level.

### spawn_actor_in_pie(class_path, location, rotation) -> str

Spawn an actor in the PIE world. `class_path` accepts both native
classes (`/Script/Engine.StaticMeshActor`) and Blueprints — the `_C`
suffix is auto-appended if the raw path fails to load. Uses
`AlwaysSpawn` collision handling so overlapping spawns succeed.

Returns the new actor's `FName` on success, empty string on failure.

```python
name = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.spawn_actor_in_pie(
    '/Script/Engine.StaticMeshActor',
    unreal.Vector(500, 0, 100),
    unreal.Rotator(0, 0, 0))
```

### destroy_actor_in_pie(actor_name) -> bool

Destroy a PIE actor by `FName` or display label. Returns False if the
actor is missing or PIE isn't running.

### get_pie_actor_location(actor_name) -> Vector or None

World location of a PIE actor. UE Python bool-plus-outparam convention
— returns the `FVector` on success, `None` otherwise.

### find_pie_actors_by_class(class_path) -> list[str]

FName-as-string list of every PIE actor whose class derives from
`class_path`. Pass `/Script/Engine.Actor` to enumerate everything.

**Pitfalls**

- PIE actors created via `spawn_actor_in_pie` vanish when PIE stops —
  they are *not* persisted to the level. For persistent placement use
  `bridge-level-api.spawn_actor` instead.
- `find_pie_actors_by_class` returns FNames, which include runtime
  suffixes (`BP_Foo_C_0`, `..._1`) that differ between PIE sessions.
  Use class-based filtering rather than hard-coded names.

---

## Time dilation control

Scales delta-time delivered to actor ticks. DISTINCT from
`bridge-editor-api.pause_pie` — pause hard-stops the play session;
time dilation keeps ticking at a scaled rate (e.g. `0.25` = quarter
speed for bullet-time, `4.0` = fast-forward). Zero is rejected — use
`pause_pie` for a true pause.

### get_global_time_dilation() -> float

Current world-level `AWorldSettings::TimeDilation`. Returns `1.0`
outside PIE.

### set_global_time_dilation(scale) -> bool

World-level time dilation. Clamped to `[0.0001, 20.0]`; zero rejected.
Persists after PIE stops if you don't restore — teardown scripts
should call `set_global_time_dilation(1.0)` to reset.

### get_actor_time_dilation(actor_name) -> float

Per-actor `AActor::CustomTimeDilation` (multiplied by the global).
Returns `-1.0` on missing actor / no PIE.

### set_actor_time_dilation(actor_name, scale) -> bool

Per-actor multiplier. Combined effective tick rate is
`global * actor_scale`. Useful for making a single enemy move
faster/slower without affecting the whole world.

```python
# Bullet-time on one target
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.set_global_time_dilation(0.25)
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.set_actor_time_dilation('Boss', 4.0)
# Boss ticks at global*actor = 0.25 * 4.0 = 1.0 (normal speed)
# Everything else ticks at 0.25 (slow-mo)
```

---

## Audio + damage proxies

Thin wrappers around `UGameplayStatics` for common gameplay triggers.
All target the PIE world and no-op outside PIE.

### play_sound2d(sound_asset_path, volume_multiplier=1.0, pitch_multiplier=1.0) -> bool

Play a 2D (non-spatialized) sound. Returns False if PIE isn't running
or the asset fails to load.

### play_sound_at_location(sound_asset_path, location, volume_multiplier=1.0, pitch_multiplier=1.0) -> bool

Spatialized version — attenuation follows the sound asset's own
attenuation settings.

### apply_damage_to_actor(target_actor_name, damage_amount) -> float

Point damage via `UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage`. Returns the damage
value actually applied (post-modifiers, per the target's `TakeDamage`).
Returns `-1.0` for missing target / no PIE. Instigator is the player
pawn / controller.

### apply_radial_damage(origin, damage_amount, inner_radius, outer_radius) -> int

Sphere-falloff damage via `UGameplayStatics::ApplyRadialDamageWithFalloff`.
`inner_radius` = full damage, `outer_radius` = zero damage, linear falloff.
Returns the count of actors within `outer_radius` at the time of the
call (regardless of per-actor damage taken — zero-damage hits still
count). Player pawn is excluded.

```python
hits = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.apply_radial_damage(
    unreal.Vector(0, 0, 0), 100.0, 500.0, 2000.0)
print(f'{hits} actors within blast radius')
```

---

## Multi-pawn + controller queries

Read-only queries that widen the single-player helpers
(`get_agent_observation` etc., which only inspect the first player
pawn) to every pawn / AI agent in the PIE world.

### get_all_pawns() -> list[str]

FNames of every `APawn` in the PIE world, in iterator order. Empty
outside PIE.

### get_ai_pawns() -> list[str]

Subset of `get_all_pawns` whose possessing controller's class name
contains `"AIController"`. AI detection is name-based to avoid
pulling the `AIModule` into the plugin's build deps — custom AI
controllers with non-standard names may be missed.

### get_actor_controller(actor_name) -> str

Short class name of the controller currently possessing a PIE actor
(e.g. `"PlayerController"`, `"AIController"`, `"BP_EnemyAIController_C"`).
Empty string when the actor isn't a pawn or has no controller.

### is_actor_ai_controlled(actor_name) -> bool

Convenience: True when `get_actor_controller` returns a class name
containing `"AIController"`.

```python
for name in unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_all_pawns():
    ctrl = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_actor_controller(name)
    print(f'{name}: {ctrl}')
```

---

## On-screen debug + debug drawing

Visualise agent state in the PIE viewport. All four require PIE and
no-op otherwise. Durations are capped per-call and auto-clear when
they expire.

### add_on_screen_debug_message(message, duration_seconds=4.0, r=1.0, g=1.0, b=1.0) -> bool

Print a line on the viewport via `GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage`.
`duration_seconds` clamped to `[0.1, 60]`. RGB channels in `[0, 1]`.

```python
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.add_on_screen_debug_message(
    f'path len={len(waypoints)}', 3.0, 0.2, 1.0, 0.2)
```

### clear_on_screen_debug_messages() -> bool

Remove every on-screen debug line currently visible.

### draw_debug_line(start, end, thickness=1.0, duration_seconds=5.0) -> bool

Draw a yellow line segment in the PIE world. Use `duration_seconds=0`
for single-frame draws (next tick erases). Color is yellow by design
— cycle through locations / colours yourself if you need per-line
tinting.

### draw_debug_sphere_at(center, radius=50.0, thickness=1.0, duration_seconds=5.0) -> bool

Draw a yellow wireframe sphere (16 segments).

### draw_debug_box_at(center, extent, thickness=1.0, duration_seconds=5.0) -> bool

Axis-aligned wireframe box. `extent` is the half-size on each axis.

### draw_debug_arrow(start, end, arrow_size=20.0, duration_seconds=5.0) -> bool

Directional arrow — line + arrowhead. `arrow_size` is the head length
in cm; total length is `|end - start|` regardless.

### draw_debug_string(text, location, duration_seconds=5.0) -> bool

World-anchored text label rendered via the engine debug text system.
Visible only inside the PIE viewport — not captured by high-res
screenshots.

### flush_persistent_debug_draws() -> bool

Clear every persistent (duration > 0) debug-draw primitive — lines,
spheres, boxes, arrows, strings — in the PIE world at once. Single-
frame draws (duration = 0) expire naturally on the next tick and
don't need this.

---

## Pawn basis vectors + distance

Convenience getters around the PIE player pawn's orientation.
Vector returns follow the UE Python bool-plus-outparam convention —
the `Vector` on success, `None` outside PIE / no pawn.

### get_pawn_forward_vector() -> Vector or None

Unit forward direction in world space.

### get_pawn_right_vector() -> Vector or None

Unit right direction.

### get_pawn_up_vector() -> Vector or None

Unit up direction.

### get_distance_to_pawn(location) -> float

Distance in cm from the pawn's pivot to `location`. Returns `-1.0`
outside PIE / no pawn.

```python
if unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_distance_to_pawn(waypoint) < 100:
    # reached waypoint, advance
    ...
```

---

## PIE clock / counter queries

Cheap reads for agent-loop pacing + scene-level status.

### get_pie_frame_number() -> int

`GFrameCounter` — global engine frame counter, advances every tick
including editor-only frames (not PIE-exclusive). Use deltas, not
absolute values.

### get_pie_delta_seconds() -> float

Last delta-seconds the PIE world ticked with. Returns `0.0` outside
PIE. Combine with `get_global_time_dilation` to sanity-check the
effective tick rate.

### get_pie_num_players() -> int

Count of player controllers in the PIE world (split-screen /
multi-player scenarios).

### get_pie_num_ai_controllers() -> int

Count of controllers whose class name contains `"AIController"`.
Matches the detection used by `get_ai_pawns` — custom AI controllers
with non-standard names are missed.

---

## Physics impulse / force

Target the PIE actor's primary `UPrimitiveComponent` (root if it's a
primitive, otherwise the first primitive found). The body must have
physics simulation enabled — see
`bridge-level-api.set_actor_simulate_physics`. Non-PIE calls and
missing actors return `False` / `None`.

### add_impulse_to_pie_actor(actor_name, impulse, velocity_change=False) -> bool

Apply an instantaneous impulse in kg·cm/s. `velocity_change=True`
treats `impulse` as a delta-velocity (ignores mass).

### add_force_to_pie_actor(actor_name, force) -> bool

Apply a continuous force this frame (kg·cm/s²). Reapply each tick
for sustained acceleration — otherwise behaves like a kick.

### wake_pie_actor_physics(actor_name) -> bool

Wake every rigid body on the actor so the next tick processes forces.
No-op for non-simulating bodies.

### get_pie_actor_linear_velocity(actor_name) -> Vector or None

`UPrimitiveComponent::GetPhysicsLinearVelocity` in cm/s. Returns `None`
outside PIE / missing actor; returns `Vector(0, 0, 0)` for bodies that
exist but aren't simulating.

```python
# Push a physics cube sideways, read result after a frame
unreal.UnrealBridgeLevelLibrary.set_actor_simulate_physics('Cube', True)
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.add_impulse_to_pie_actor(
    'Cube', unreal.Vector(500, 0, 0), True)
```

---

## Camera shake control

Thin wrappers around `APlayerController` / `UGameplayStatics` shake
APIs. Class paths resolve to a `UCameraShakeBase` subclass — native
(e.g. `/Script/Engine.MatineeCameraShake`) or Blueprint
(`/Game/Camera/BP_HitShake_C`; `_C` auto-appended if the raw path
fails to load).

### start_camera_shake(shake_class_path, scale=1.0) -> bool

Play a shake on the local player. Auto-stops after its default
duration. `scale` is clamped to ≥ 0.

### stop_camera_shake_by_class(shake_class_path, immediately=True) -> bool

Stop shakes of the given class on the local player. `immediately=False`
lets the blend-out phase play.

### stop_all_camera_shakes(immediately=True) -> bool

Stop every shake currently playing. Returns True even when no shakes
are active (no-op).

### play_world_camera_shake(shake_class_path, epicenter, inner_radius, outer_radius, scale_multiplier=1.0) -> bool

Radial-falloff shake — every camera within `outer_radius` of
`epicenter` feels it, strength scales from full at `inner_radius` to
zero at `outer_radius`. Useful for explosion or impact effects.

---

## Player pawn / start / respawn

### get_player_pawn_actor_name() -> str

FName of the first PIE player pawn. Empty outside PIE / no pawn.
Use this when passing the player pawn to a Level / Gameplay API that
takes an actor name.

### get_player_start_actor_name() -> str

FName of the first `APlayerStart` actor. Matches by class-name
substring (`"PlayerStart"`), so custom PlayerStart subclasses are
picked up. Empty when no PlayerStart exists. Falls back to the editor
world when PIE isn't running.

### get_player_start_transform() -> (Vector, Rotator) or None

World transform of the first PlayerStart. Returns `None` when no
PlayerStart is present.

### respawn_player_pawn() -> bool

Convenience: teleport the player pawn to the first PlayerStart with
velocity zeroed and controller rotation snapped. Wraps `teleport_pawn`
against the values from `get_player_start_transform`.

```python
# Reset scenario between agent-training episodes
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.respawn_player_pawn()
```

---

## Runtime pause + game class queries

Runtime-side (`UGameplayStatics`) pause and class lookups. Distinct
from `bridge-editor-api.pause_pie`, which targets the editor's
play-session facility. Both pauses work; this one reads/writes the
game-side flag that stops actor ticks.

### pause_game(paused) -> bool

Set runtime game pause. False outside PIE.

### is_game_paused() -> bool

Read runtime game pause state.

### get_game_mode_class_name() -> str

Short class name of the active `AGameModeBase` (e.g.
`"GM_UnitCharacter_C"` for Blueprint game modes). Empty outside PIE.

### get_game_state_class_name() -> str

Short class name of the active `AGameStateBase`. Empty outside PIE.

```python
# Visualise a nav path
path, *_ = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.find_nav_path(
    obs.pawn_location, goal)
for i in range(len(path) - 1):
    unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.draw_debug_line(path[i], path[i+1], 2.0, 5.0)
```

---

## Enhanced Input mapping contexts

Runtime IMC management via `UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem`. All
four require PIE + a local-player Enhanced Input subsystem.

### add_mapping_context(mapping_context_path, priority=0) -> bool

Add a Mapping Context asset. Higher `priority` wins when multiple
contexts bind the same key. Returns False on failed asset load or
subsystem unavailable.

### remove_mapping_context(mapping_context_path) -> bool

Remove a previously-added Mapping Context.

### is_mapping_context_active(mapping_context_path) -> bool

True when the Mapping Context is currently applied on the local player.

### get_input_action_value_type(input_action_path) -> str

Declared value type of an `UInputAction` asset: `"Bool"` | `"Axis1D"`
| `"Axis2D"` | `"Axis3D"` | `"Unknown"`. Empty when the asset fails
to load. Pair with `set_sticky_input` to confirm your injected
`FVector` matches the IA's shape.

```python
ty = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_input_action_value_type(
    '/LocomotionDriver/Input/IA_Move')
# ty == 'Axis2D' → pass Vector(x, y, 0)
```

### get_input_action_triggers(input_action_path) -> (Array[str], Array[float]) or None

Inspect the `Triggers` array declared on the IA asset. Returns parallel
arrays of short trigger names (`"Pressed"`, `"Released"`, `"Hold"`,
`"Tap"`, `"Pulse"`, `"Down"`, `"ChordAction"`) and a threshold in seconds
parsed from `HoldTimeThreshold` / `TapReleaseTimeThreshold` / `Interval`
(0.0 when the trigger has no timing parameter). Returns `None` on load
failure.

Only inspects triggers declared on the IA itself — per-mapping triggers
configured inside an Input Mapping Context are NOT reflected.

```python
names, thresholds = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_input_action_triggers(
    '/LocomotionDriver/Input/IA_Jump')
# names == ['Down'], thresholds == [0.0]
```

### trigger_input_action(input_action_path, hold_seconds=-1.0) -> bool

Adaptive "press a Bool IA" entry point. Inspects the IA's `Triggers` and
picks between a single-tick pulse (same as `inject_enhanced_input_axis`)
and a timed sticky-hold with automatic release — the caller doesn't
need to know whether the action listens to Pressed / Released / Hold /
Tap / Down.

`hold_seconds` semantics:
- `< 0` (default): auto-pick from Triggers. `Hold(t)` → sticky `t + 0.05s`.
  `Tap(t)` → sticky `max(0.01, t * 0.5)s`. Any `Released` / `Pulse` / `Down`
  → sticky `0.15s`. Otherwise (Pressed-only, empty) → single-tick pulse.
- `== 0`: force single-tick pulse.
- `> 0`: force sticky hold for exactly this many seconds.

Rejects Axis1D / Axis2D / Axis3D IAs with `False` — use `set_sticky_input`
for continuous axes. The auto-clear deadline is checked in world-time,
so a `Hold(1.0)` trigger still fires correctly under 0.5× time dilation.

```python
L = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary
# Discrete toggle — single pulse suffices.
L.trigger_input_action('/LocomotionDriver/Input/IA_SwitchAnimStyle.IA_SwitchAnimStyle')
# Jump — auto-picks 150ms hold because IA has a Down trigger.
L.trigger_input_action('/LocomotionDriver/Input/IA_Jump.IA_Jump')
# Force-override the hold length (e.g. for a longer-press ability).
L.trigger_input_action('/Game/Input/IA_ChargeShot.IA_ChargeShot', 1.2)
```

## Actuators

All actuators target the PIE world's first player pawn/controller and
return `bool` (maps to `True`/`False` in Python — there are no out-params
so the return is a plain bool, not a struct-or-None tuple).

Input is accumulated per-frame by UE: each `apply_*_input` call contributes
to the current tick's input and is then consumed by the movement component.
A Python agent should call these once per tick for continuous behaviour. If
the agent stops calling them, the pawn decelerates on the next frame.

### apply_movement_input(world_direction, scale_value=1.0, force=False) -> bool

Wraps `APawn::AddMovementInput`. Direction is world-space; magnitude is
ignored (UE normalises). Scale in `[-1, 1]` flips and scales the input.

```python
import unreal
# Walk forward along the pawn's current facing.
obs = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_agent_observation()
forward = obs.pawn_rotation.rotate_vector(unreal.Vector(1, 0, 0))
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.apply_movement_input(forward, 1.0)
```

### apply_look_input(yaw_delta, pitch_delta) -> bool

Wraps `APlayerController::AddYawInput` / `AddPitchInput`. Values are in
"input units" — the same units the mouse delta would deliver through the
input mapping context, typically ~1 unit per degree.

### set_control_rotation(new_rotation) -> bool

Instantly snaps the controller's rotation; skips input smoothing. Useful
for "face this actor" commands or test teleports where continuous look
input would add unwanted visual ramp-up.

### jump() -> bool  /  stop_jumping() -> bool

Mirror of `ACharacter::Jump` / `StopJumping`. Returns False if the pawn
isn't a Character. For a tap jump, call `jump()` one tick and
`stop_jumping()` the next; for a variable-height jump hold `jump()`
across N ticks then release.

### Pitfalls

- `apply_movement_input` is a one-shot per tick. If the Python loop
  pauses longer than ~33 ms (one frame at 30 FPS), the pawn visibly
  stutters to a stop. Run the agent loop at or above the UE tick rate.
- `apply_look_input`'s scale depends on the project's mapping; for an
  unconfigured controller it may feel rotated by 0 degrees (no input
  binding). Prefer `set_control_rotation` for deterministic aiming.
- Actions/fire/interact (EnhancedInput IA triggers) are a separate
  actuator batch and not covered here yet.

---

## EnhancedInput injection (for projects that bypass AddMovementInput)

Many gameplay projects route WASD → `UInputAction` → GAS ability instead
of the classic `APawn::AddMovementInput` path. For those, the direct
actuators above look like no-ops because the game never reads the pawn's
input vector. Two injection flavours:

### inject_enhanced_input_axis(input_action_path, axis_value) -> bool

One-tick injection. Good for discrete press actions (`IA_Jump`,
`IA_Interact`) — single call fires the IA's `Pressed` / `Triggered`
phase for the frame.

**Not suitable for held axes.** A continuously-held axis like `IA_Move`
or `IA_Look` needs a value every UE frame; the Python bridge can't
reliably match 60 FPS, so use sticky inject instead.

**Value coercion**: the FVector you pass is automatically converted to
the IA's declared `EInputActionValueType` (Bool/Axis1D/Axis2D/Axis3D).
Pass `(1, 0, 0)` for a bool "pressed"; for Axis2D WASD pass `(x, y, 0)`.

### set_sticky_input(input_action_path, axis_value) -> bool  /  clear_sticky_input(input_action_path="") -> bool

Register a sticky injection: a server-side FTSTicker re-injects the
registered IA/value **every GameThread frame** until cleared. Set once
from Python, input persists at engine frame rate.

- `set_sticky_input(path, value)` — register or overwrite one entry.
- `clear_sticky_input(path)` — remove one entry by path.
- `clear_sticky_input("")` — clear all entries.

Multiple IAs can be sticky at the same time (e.g. move + look + sprint
all held). Passing a zero vector does NOT clear — it injects zero
every frame (useful to keep the binding alive while temporarily
suspending input without losing the subscription).

Sticky entries are auto-dropped when PIE ends, so each fresh PIE
session starts with no sticky input. The server-side ticker stops
running when the registry is empty.

**Example — hold forward for 2s:**

Each `bridge.exec` runs on the GameThread, so a Python `time.sleep`
inside one exec freezes the engine — the sticky ticker stops, no frames
advance, the pawn doesn't move during the sleep. Drive duration from
outside the exec (two execs separated by a wall-clock pause), or use
the reactive Timer adapter (next pattern).

```python
# exec #1 — start holding forward
import unreal
IA = '/Game/Input/IA_Move.IA_Move'
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.set_sticky_input(IA, unreal.Vector(0, 1, 0))
```
```bash
sleep 2   # wall-clock pause in the calling shell, NOT inside an exec
```
```python
# exec #2 — release
import unreal
unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.clear_sticky_input('/Game/Input/IA_Move.IA_Move')
```

Pawn accelerates within one frame, holds walk speed during the gap,
decelerates on clear.

### Pattern: chase a (possibly moving) target and stop on arrival

Steering toward a world-space target requires four things every frame:

1. **Re-read** both pawn and target locations (target may be moving).
2. **Compute direction** — desired yaw `atan2(dy, dx)`, then shortest
   signed-arc delta against current control rotation.
3. **Steer the camera** — `apply_look_input(delta / damping, 0)`.
   Camera yaw drives the IA_Move forward direction (camera-relative
   axis), so the pawn naturally curves onto the line to the target.
4. **Drive forward** — keep `IA_Move` sticky at the project's "forward"
   Axis2D vector (typically `(0, 1, 0)` — verify per project).
5. **Arrival check** — when XY distance < arrive radius,
   `clear_sticky_input("")` and unregister the loop.

A Python `while + time.sleep` loop does NOT work for this:
`bridge.exec` runs on the GameThread, so `time.sleep` halts UE itself —
the sticky ticker stops re-injecting, no frames advance, the polled pawn
position never changes, and the loop spins on stale data. The right
primitive is the reactive Timer adapter
(`UnrealBridgeReactiveLibrary.register_runtime_timer`, see
`bridge-reactive.md`), which fires a Python callback between ticks at
the configured interval — UE keeps ticking, the sticky ticker keeps
running, positions stay live.

```python
"""chase_target.py — drive pawn toward a (possibly moving) actor.

Run with:  bridge.py exec-file chase_target.py
Idempotent: any prior chase_target handler is unregistered first.
The chase loop self-unregisters on arrival.

**Why `clear_sticky_input("")` stops the pawn:** the sticky ticker
re-injects the registered IA value every GameThread frame. Clearing the
map leaves Enhanced Input with no new input, the character movement
component stops receiving an acceleration target, and UE's deceleration
brings speed to 0 naturally — you are *not* braking, you are letting go
of the virtual stick. Same mechanism for sprint or any held IA.

**Tuning the arrive radius.** ~250–400 cm for foot nav — the character
cannot converge on an exact point because of movement-component
deceleration, foot-IK, and collision slop. Tighter radii cause overshoot
and oscillation. Always use XY-only distance; a Z-floating target (or
one on a different floor) will never satisfy a 3D-distance check.

**Tuning `LOOK_DAMPING` and `LOOK_STEP_CAP`.** `apply_look_input` is
scaled by the project's mouse sensitivity before reaching the
controller. If yaw flips sign around the target each tick, raise
damping. If the camera turns too slowly to keep up with a moving
target, lower it. Calibrate once with a fixed-target script: send
`apply_look_input(20, 0)` from a single exec and measure how many
degrees of yaw the controller reports — that ratio is your effective
sensitivity multiplier; pick `LOOK_DAMPING` ≥ that value.

**Forward-axis convention.** `IA_Move` is camera-relative; whether
forward is `(0, 1, 0)` or `(1, 0, 0)` depends on which Axis2D the
project's Input Mapping Context bound to W/S vs A/D. Confirm with
`get_input_action_value_type(IA_MOVE) == 'Axis2D'`, then test once:
push `(0, 1, 0)` for ~1 s and check whether the pawn moves forward or
strafes. If the project also exposes a strafe-toggle action
(orientation-locked movement), make sure it is *off* — strafe mode
decouples facing from movement and breaks the camera-drives-direction
assumption.

**Stopping behaviour after arrival.** This pattern fully unregisters on
arrival, so if the target moves away again the pawn stays put. For a
"keep tracking, re-engage on drift" controller, replace the unregister
branch with a state flag (e.g. store `state['arrived'] = True`,
re-enter chase when `dist_xy > resume_radius` with `resume_radius >
ARRIVE_CM` for hysteresis). The reactive preamble exposes a per-handler
`state` dict for this.

### Debug fields on FAgentObservation

Added to the existing observation struct to help diagnose "why isn't
my input doing anything":

- `pawn_class_name`, `movement_component_class_name`, `movement_mode`
  (see `EMovementMode`: 0=None, 1=Walking, 3=Falling, ...) — identify
  whether the pawn even has a standard `CharacterMovementComponent`.
- `last_control_input_vector` — `APawn::GetLastMovementInputVector`.
  Zero despite calling `apply_movement_input` means the input never
  reached the pawn's accumulator (probably because the project uses
  EnhancedInput-only input routing).
- `current_acceleration` — `UCharacterMovementComponent::GetCurrentAcceleration`.
  Non-zero means input got through and the movement comp is reacting;
  zero despite a non-zero `last_control_input_vector` points at a
  root-motion / custom locomotion override.

## State inspection + reset

Small surface for "is the agent loop even running?" and "put the pawn
back to a known state" scenarios, without round-tripping a full
observation.

### is_in_pie() -> bool

True when a PIE world is currently playing **and** a player pawn has
spawned. Cheap gate for Python loops that should no-op outside PIE.

```python
import unreal
if not unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.is_in_pie():
    return  # agent loop waits for PIE to start
```

### get_control_rotation() -> FRotator or None

Read the current `APlayerController::GetControlRotation`. Pairs with
`set_control_rotation` — use this to remember the pre-teleport camera
direction so you can restore it after a scenario ends.

Returns `None` when PIE is not running (UE Python bool-plus-outparam
convention). On success returns the `FRotator` directly.

```python
rot = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_control_rotation()
if rot is not None:
    print(f'camera yaw={rot.yaw:.1f}')
```

### get_sticky_inputs() -> (count, paths, values)

Enumerate active sticky EnhancedInput entries. Returned as a 3-tuple:
- `count` (int): number of entries.
- `paths` (array of str): each entry's asset path, e.g.
  `/LocomotionDriver/Input/IA_Move`.
- `values` (array of Vector): per-entry injected value, same index as `paths`.

Useful for asserting "no input is being held" between scenarios, or
inspecting a live input-replay script.

```python
count, paths, values = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_sticky_inputs()
for p, v in zip(paths, values):
    print(f'  {p} = ({v.x}, {v.y}, {v.z})')
```

### get_camera_hit_actor(max_distance=10000.0) -> str

Line-trace forward from the player camera for up to `max_distance` cm
against the visibility channel. Returns the FIRST actor's `FName` as
string (matches `FAgentVisibleActor.actor_name`, *not* the display
label), or empty string on miss / no PIE. The pawn is auto-ignored so
self-hits never occur.

```python
target = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_camera_hit_actor(5000.0)
if target:
    print(f'aiming at {target}')
```

### get_camera_hit_location(max_distance, out_hit_location) -> bool

UE Python convention: returns `FVector` when the ray hits, `None` when
it misses or PIE isn't running. The hit point is `FHitResult.ImpactPoint`.

```python
loc = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_camera_hit_location(10000.0)
if loc is not None:
    print(f'aim point = {loc}')
```

### is_actor_visible_from_camera(actor_name, max_distance=10000.0) -> bool

Bounds-sampling visibility test: traces from the camera to nine sample
points on the target's bounds (center + 8 corners). Returns True as
soon as ANY ray reaches the target or its endpoint unobstructed; False
if every sample is blocked by another actor first.

`actor_name` is matched first by `FName`, then by display label. Pass
the value returned by `get_camera_hit_actor()` directly.

**Pitfalls**

- Bounds are evaluated via `AActor::GetActorBounds(bOnlyCollidingComponents=false)`.
  Actors without any primitive components return zero bounds — all 9
  samples collapse to the pivot, which may be occluded.
- When the camera is inside another actor's collision (e.g. a default
  PIE spectator spawned inside geometry), every outbound ray hits that
  actor first and this check returns False even for visually-unobstructed
  targets. Fix by possessing a proper pawn before querying.
- The pawn is auto-ignored, but sibling occluders (smoke volumes,
  trigger boxes on Visibility channel) are not — they'll register as
  blockers.

### get_pawn_ground_height(max_distance=5000.0) -> float

Downward line-trace from the pawn's pivot for up to `max_distance` cm.
Returns the distance to the first hit surface in cm, or `-1.0` on miss
/ no PIE. Useful for stairs/drop detection without parsing the full
`CharacterMovement` state.

```python
h = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_pawn_ground_height()
if h < 0:
    print('pawn is airborne or over a bottomless pit')
elif h > 200:
    print(f'drop below is {h:.0f} cm')
```

---

### teleport_pawn(new_location, new_rotation, snap_controller=True, stop_velocity=True) -> bool

Hard-reset the pawn's pose for scenario setup. Wraps
`SetActorLocationAndRotation(..., ETeleportType::TeleportPhysics)` and
optionally stops movement + snaps the controller rotation to match.

- `snap_controller=True` (default): also set the player controller's
  rotation. Keeps `apply_movement_input(forward)` intuitive post-teleport.
  Set False if the camera/controller should retain its existing aim.
- `stop_velocity=True` (default): call `StopMovementImmediately` on
  the movement component so the character doesn't slide past the target
  on the next physics tick. Set False to preserve momentum (e.g. to
  launch from a moving state into a new pose).

```python
import unreal
ok = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.teleport_pawn(
    new_location=unreal.Vector(500, 0, 100),
    new_rotation=unreal.Rotator(0, 0, 0),
    snap_controller=True,
    stop_velocity=True,
)
```

**Pitfalls**
- Returns False outside PIE (no pawn to teleport).
- The pawn's collision shape is swept at `TeleportPhysics` — if the
  target location is inside a wall, physics will still resolve it on the
  next tick (may nudge the pawn out). For pure geometric test setups,
  pick a location in clear space.
- Non-Character pawns skip `StopMovementImmediately` gracefully (their
  `UPawnMovementComponent::StopMovementImmediately` is a no-op).

## Pawn capabilities

### get_pawn_capabilities() -> tuple or None

Read the pawn's traversal capabilities out of
`CharacterMovementComponent` + `CapsuleComponent` — the numbers an
agent needs to reason about "can I fit / jump / step up there". Returns
`None` when there is no PIE pawn or the pawn is not an `ACharacter`.

Returns a 9-tuple:
```
(jump_z_velocity,       # cm/s — vertical launch speed from Jump()
 max_walk_speed,        # cm/s — current walking cap
 max_step_height,       # cm — height the movement comp auto-steps
 walkable_floor_angle,  # degrees — slopes shallower than this count as floor
 capsule_radius,        # cm — half-width of the collision capsule
 capsule_half_height,   # cm — half-height standing up
 crouched_half_height,  # cm — half-height while crouched
 can_crouch,          # bool — movement mode allows crouch
 can_jump)            # bool — NavAgentProps.bCanJump
```

```python
caps = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.get_pawn_capabilities()
if caps:
    jz, ws, sh, wa, cr, chh, crchh, ccr, cjp = caps
    print(f'jump={jz:.0f} step={sh:.0f} capsule R/H={cr:.0f}/{chh:.0f}')
    print(f'crouched half-h={crchh:.0f} can_crouch={ccr} can_jump={cjp}')
```

**Usage:** combine with `measure_ceiling_height` to decide "can I crouch
under this?" (ceiling < `capsule_half_height * 2` but ≥ `crouched_half_height * 2`),
or with `simulate_jump_arc` to predict "can I clear this wall?"
(`jump_z_velocity` feeds the initial velocity).

### simulate_jump_arc(start_location, initial_velocity, max_time, step_dt, max_path_length) -> (Vector, str) or None

Simulate a projectile arc from `start_location` with
`initial_velocity`, stepping ballistics at `step_dt` until something
is hit, `max_time` runs out, or `max_path_length` in travelled
distance is reached. Uses the PIE world's gravity (`pawn.GravityScale`
is NOT applied — scale the velocity yourself if needed).

Returns `(land_location, land_actor_label)` when the arc hits
something (floor or wall). Returns `None` when the arc timed out in
midair without hitting geometry.

```python
L = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary
caps = L.get_pawn_capabilities()
jump_z = caps[0]   # e.g. 500 cm/s
fwd = L.get_pawn_forward_vector()
# Simulate a forward jump
velocity = unreal.Vector(fwd.x * 400, fwd.y * 400, jump_z)
pawn_loc = L.get_pie_actor_location(L.get_player_pawn_actor_name())
result = L.simulate_jump_arc(
    unreal.Vector(pawn_loc.x, pawn_loc.y, pawn_loc.z + 90),
    velocity, 3.0, 0.05, 5000.0)
if result:
    land_loc, land_actor = result
    print(f'land at ({land_loc.x:.0f},{land_loc.y:.0f},{land_loc.z:.0f}) on {land_actor}')
else:
    print('arc timed out — no collision')
```

**Pitfalls:**
- The pawn's own capsule is excluded from traces so the arc doesn't
  immediately self-intersect at the start location.
- `step_dt` precision: 0.05 (20 Hz) is fine for rough estimates; use
  0.01 if you need sub-cm landing precision (but 5× slower).
- World gravity is typically `–980 cm/s²` in UE defaults. Verify with
  `unreal.GameplayStatics.get_global_gravity_z()`.

---

## Slate-level key injection (UI / menu control)

When a UI popup / full-screen menu is active, UE typically removes all
gameplay `InputMappingContext`s. In this state **every Enhanced Input
injection is silently dropped** — `inject_enhanced_input_axis`,
`set_sticky_input`, and `trigger_input_action` all return True but
produce no effect because no IMC is listening.

**Detection:** call `is_mapping_context_active` on the project's
gameplay IMCs. If none are active while PIE is running, a blocking UI
is open.

### press_key(key_name, pressed) -> bool

Inject a key event directly into `FSlateApplication`, bypassing
Enhanced Input entirely. The event reaches whatever Slate widget
currently has focus (UMG menus, CommonUI navigation, etc.).

**Parameters**
- `key_name` (str): UE `FKey` name — any string accepted by the
  `FKey(FName)` constructor.
- `pressed` (bool, default True): True = key down, False = key up.

**Returns** True if the event was dispatched.

```python
import unreal
L = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary

# Gamepad A button (confirm) — press then release
L.press_key('Gamepad_FaceButton_Bottom', True)
L.press_key('Gamepad_FaceButton_Bottom', False)

# D-pad navigation
L.press_key('Gamepad_DPad_Down', True)
L.press_key('Gamepad_DPad_Down', False)
```

**Common FKey names**

| Purpose | FKey name |
|---------|-----------|
| Gamepad A (confirm) | `Gamepad_FaceButton_Bottom` |
| Gamepad B (back) | `Gamepad_FaceButton_Right` |
| Gamepad X | `Gamepad_FaceButton_Left` |
| Gamepad Y | `Gamepad_FaceButton_Top` |
| D-pad Up | `Gamepad_DPad_Up` |
| D-pad Down | `Gamepad_DPad_Down` |
| D-pad Left | `Gamepad_DPad_Left` |
| D-pad Right | `Gamepad_DPad_Right` |
| Left Stick axes | `Gamepad_LeftX`, `Gamepad_LeftY` |
| Right Stick axes | `Gamepad_RightX`, `Gamepad_RightY` |
| Shoulder L/R | `Gamepad_LeftShoulder`, `Gamepad_RightShoulder` |
| Trigger L/R | `Gamepad_LeftTrigger`, `Gamepad_RightTrigger` |
| Keyboard Enter | `Enter` |
| Keyboard Space | `SpaceBar` |
| Keyboard Backspace | `BackSpace` |
| Keyboard Escape | `Escape` |

### Pattern: navigate a gamepad-driven menu

```python
import unreal, time
L = unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary

def tap(key):
    """Press and release a key with a small gap."""
    L.press_key(key, True)
    L.press_key(key, False)

# Move selection down twice, then confirm
tap('Gamepad_DPad_Down')
tap('Gamepad_DPad_Down')
tap('Gamepad_FaceButton_Bottom')  # A = confirm
```

**Note:** because `press_key` runs on the GameThread inside the
bridge, both the down and up events are processed in the same frame.
For menus that require the key to be held across frames (rare), insert
a `time.sleep` between down and up — but beware: sleeping inside
`exec` blocks the GameThread. For held keys, use two separate bridge
calls with a bash-side sleep in between:

```bash
bridge.py exec "unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.press_key('Gamepad_FaceButton_Bottom', True)"
sleep 0.2
bridge.py exec "unreal.UnrealBridgeGameplayLibrary.press_key('Gamepad_FaceButton_Bottom', False)"
```

### Fallback: OS-level key simulation

For **keyboard** keys only (not gamepad), an alternative is
`ctypes.windll.user32.keybd_event` run from the Claude-side Python
process (NOT inside bridge exec). This is useful when the bridge is
unreachable or for non-UE windows.

```python
# Run from bash, NOT inside bridge exec
python -c "
import ctypes, time
VK_E = 0x45
ctypes.windll.user32.keybd_event(VK_E, 0, 0, 0)
time.sleep(0.05)
ctypes.windll.user32.keybd_event(VK_E, 0, 0x0002, 0)
"
```

**Pitfalls (OS-level)**

- Targets the **foreground window** — UE editor must be active.
- Windows-only. On macOS/Linux, use platform equivalents.
- Cannot inject gamepad events (XInput is polled, not event-driven).

Prefer `press_key` over OS-level simulation whenever the bridge is
available — it works regardless of window focus, supports both
keyboard and gamepad keys, and runs on the GameThread with no timing
ambiguity.
